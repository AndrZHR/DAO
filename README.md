# DAO

the root DAO of the Decentralists

## TODO

- [ ] Mission -- what are we here for
- [ ] Plan -- high level plan with sequence
- [ ] Bylaws -- the structure of checks and balances
- [ ] HowItWorks -- some main descriptive document that guides users
- [ ] Initial Categories of Cosmos Hub work -- split atom2.0, but also other needed improvements
- [ ] About -- how we came to be
- [ ] CodeOfConduct -- applies everywhere on-chain and off-chain
- [ ] Members and Partners -- member individuals and partner organizations

## Mission 

Better discourse for better organization management (through smart contracts).

## Plan

The community is asking what the NWV's plans are.

The one thing we can all get behind is the need for fund for alternative
control and governance structures.  So while ATOM2.0 proposes one such treasury
DAO with charter, we hereby propose an alternative DAO, let's call it the
Decentralists Cosmos Hub DAO.

This Decentralists Cosmos Hub DAO contains categories that discuss the topics
needed for Cosmos Hub improvement. Tokenomics, governance, development,
security, interchain staking or ICS, incentive alignment, budgeting, etc are
all categories that discuss the merits of proposals.

Within each category, multiple groups can compete to provide services as
suggested by the category DAO. That way we can have competition among peer
groups but constructive discourse and on-chain accountability to let the best
groups and ideas win.

## Plan - Phases

We will define a suitable DAO framework.

 * suitable for DAO treasury management. 
 * sub-DAO support with [membership/voting/RACI/treasury/etc] features.
 * moderated with transparent policy.

A synthesis of bottom-up permissionless DAO formation to top-down governance
based "official" organization of components.

Rolled out in two phases:

Phase 1: Off-chain.
 * with existing communications infrastructure (e.g. Discord).
 * with increasingly complete organizational/moderation/administration docs.
 * with the goal to enable phase 2

Phase 2: All DAOs all the way.
 * our own (developed for Cosmos) interfaces evolve to enable structured
   conversations and granular control.
 * ensures that important conversations can happen on-chain without 
   manipulation from private interests.
 * the Cosmos stack becomes the base stack for community self-governance.
 * competition among DAO stacks too.
